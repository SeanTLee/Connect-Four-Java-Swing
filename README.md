# Connect-Four-Java-Swing
 
Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is to be the first to connect four of your pieces in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
This project uses Java Swing for the GUI, along with basic game logic to handle player moves, win conditions, and turn-based gameplay.
